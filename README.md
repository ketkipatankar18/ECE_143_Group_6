# **ECE 143 - Clothing Fit Prediction**

## Problem Statement

This project aims to: 
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Clothing Fit Dataset.
2. Develop a fit prediction system leveraging various machine learning algorithms.
3. Enhance fit prediction by integrating insights from sentiment analysis on review.
4. Incorporate hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy of the various ML models used.


## Modules Used:

- We utilized various python modules like matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, and numpy libraries in our project.
- We used several machine learning modules like sklearn.ensemble and xgboost for models like Random forest and XGBoost.
- All dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt file located at
