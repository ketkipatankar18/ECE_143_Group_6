# **ECE 143 - Clothing Fit Prediction**

## Problem Statement

This project aims to: 
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Clothing Fit Dataset.
2. Develop a fit prediction system leveraging various machine learning algorithms including 
    - Latent Factor Model using Singular Value Decomposition
    - K-Nearest Neighbors 
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost 
3. Enhance fit prediction by integrating insights from sentiment analysis on review text using MLP.
4. Incorporate hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy of the above mentioned ML models.


## Modules Used:

- We utilized various python modules like matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, and numpy libraries in our project.
- We used several machine learning modules like sklearn.ensemble and xgboost for models like Random forest and XGBoost.
- All dependencies are specified in the requirements.txt file located at https://github.com/ketkipatankar18/ECE_143_Group_6/blob/main/requirements.txt
